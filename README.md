Welcome to the README file for Shin Movie Web, a movie streaming web application created by Pham Cao Bang. This web application has been developed using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end is built using React.js, while the back-end is powered by Node.js with the Express framework. The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas, and the web application is deployed using Vercel on vercel.com.

Here is the deployed Front-end site: [https://szhin.vercel.app](https://szhin.vercel.app)
Here is the deployed Back-end site: [https://szhinbe.vercel.app](https://szhinbe.vercel.app)

  ### Connecting to MongoDB Atlas
  
  To connect the back-end to MongoDB Atlas, you need to configure the MongoDB connection string in your Node.js code. Here is an example of how to establish the connection:
  
  ```javascript
    async function connect() {
      mongoose
          .connect(process.env.NAME_URL_CONNECT_MONGODB, {          
              useNewUrlParser: true,
              useUnifiedTopology: true,
          })
          .then(() => {
              console.log('Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas!');
          })
          .catch((error) => {
              console.log('Unable to connect to MongoDB Atlas!');
              console.error(error);
          });
    }
  ```
  
  ### Libraries
  
  This is some libraries in package.json file

  ## Database
  
  Shin Movie Web utilizes MongoDB Atlas as the hosted database solution. To set up the database, follow these steps:

  You can read the docs on how to use MongoDB Atlas here: [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas).
  
  Here is an example url that you will use to connect your app to MongoDB Atlas:
  
  ```bash
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  ```
  
  Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster-url>`, and `<database>` with your MongoDB Atlas credentials and database information.
